In this program, I have render a house with four cars, which the cars are movable, by tapping the "h"key, the car in horizontal will be moving, and the traffic light will turn from red to green. By tapping the "v" key, the vertical cars will be moving, and the traffic light will turn from red to green. There is one cool features, that if the traffic light for horizon car is green and you "v", the traffic light for horizontal traffic will turn from green to red, vice versa. By tapping "s", the sun will be rotating, and the moon will rotate along with the sun in reflection, after the sun has a y coordinate lower than 0, the moon will have a y coordinate higher than 0, and the background colour will be changed and the cars' head light will be on. Besides, by pressing the arrow keys, there will be different rotation around the plane. And by scrolling the mouse's wheel, the view will be panning in and out.
