Most of the step has been implemented, however, there is a bug that the treat at the bottom right corner doesn't render at first, but after you started the game, and the pacman moved once, the treat will come out again. E2 and E3 is not implemented. I have set that the ghost will keep track to it's last movement, so with the random movement, the ghost will not keep going back and forward instead of going different directions.
